You can use the extension only on windows. You can use the extension in chrome/brave browsers. 
Note that the extension currently only works up to chrome browser version 112. If your browser is updated to a newer version, consider replacing the WidevineCdm folder of the chrome browser (usually can be found in a path like "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\113.0.5672.64"), to the WidevineCdm folder of the version of 4.10.2557.0 (this folder be found inside this extension folder. Just copy the folder and replace it in the correct location.) Alternatively you can also try to downgrade your chrome browser to any version which is equal or lower than to 112.
The extension currently works on even on the latest version of brave browser. So if you have difficulties in downgrading chrome brwoser or in replacing the WidevineCDM folder, try using the brave browser and adding the extension in there.
